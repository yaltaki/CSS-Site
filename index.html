                    About Me
                    <p>
                        A 23 year old aspiring programmer with an interest in art of all forms, not
                        just illustrations or paintings. Currently studying full-time in the Vaal
                        University of Technology (VUT) and about to start my sixth and final year.
                        Whatever free private time I have, I mostly spend furthering my hobbies. My
                        biggest objective is to design my own software framework for developing
                        video games, and I envision myself completing this task from scratch with
                        either a decade of part-time work, or half that of full-time work on this
                        hobby, although it is not a high-priority goal.
                        <br/><br/>

                            I worked as a workshop assistant for two months (June to end of July).
                            Rosen Saudi Arabia's main business is the non-destructive inspection of
                            gas and oil pipelines. My main duty was to assist the engineering
                            technicians in preparation and calibration of pigging tools.

                        <p>
                            I worked as a programmer for Noble Aerospaceâ€™s R&D department for
                            three months (start of July to start of October) for my initial WBL
                            semester. I was in charge of coding various functionalities and PC boards
                            for their proprietary gyrocopters. I also had hands-on experience with
                            designing and populating PC boards, as well as heavy use of Arduinos
                            and STM32 modules.
